# Dog breeds classification

The project involves building a neural network-based classifier in Python for breed classification of dogs using the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset).

The context of this work includes two solutions based on a fine-tuned VGG16 base model. One approach involves fine-tuning with 2 unfreezed layers, and the second involves a jointly trained model.
